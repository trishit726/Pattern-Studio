## Pattern generation engine

The procedural pattern placement engine in `src/lib/patterngen/` is **ported and
adapted from [`patterngen-oss`](https://github.com/halfof8/patterngen) by halfof8
(MIT License)**. The original is a seeded generator that scatters shapes/squares/
dots around a title; this project re-implements it to be Remotion-native and
deterministic per frame, and builds a new product around it (a live web editor,
an MP4 render pipeline, and AI-driven scene generation).
